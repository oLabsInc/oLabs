Author's decription:

A set of cursors that I created as an experiment with creating glassy effects with RealWorld Cursor designer.  They are partly transparent, but you cannot tell very well due to the small size of the transparent area (Blue spots).  It's a static set, something I haven't made in a while.

You are free to alter them in any way for yourself, but I do ask that you do not re-upload them as your own.

Download, rate, and comment, thanks!

Enjoy!  :-)
